# BRF---weather-stations
On weekend of October 15-16th 2016,  Computer Science and Geography students from Hunter College travelled upstate New York for an interdisciplinary excursion to Black Rock Forest Consortium ( as an Initiative to Increase Student Engagement and Co-curricular Activity). The trip coordinators purchased twelve Arduino microcontrollers and sensors for use as weather stations.

Prior to the trip, series of workshops were held to construct  twelve microcontroller devices that collected data. In addition to the Arduino Uno there is a Data Logging shield. The shield provides the Arduino with a real time clock for time stamping points of data, and an SD Card slot to export data off the Arduino. The shield was attached to the Arduino via pins and soldered in place. Soldering ensured that pins are securely connected for proper data transfer and prevented them from shifting during transportation. An LED light was fixed onto the Arduino itself for ease of use to provide a way of signaling to the user that certain functions are happening at any given time. Devices were placed in various places in Black Rock Forest. Accurate readings had to take place in open air away from the device, so 1 foot of wiring distanced the sensor from the Arduino. The data was collected by the BME280 Temperature, Humidity, Pressure sensor. Readings are calibrated in degrees Celcius, relative humidity, and pressure in millibars.
